# Breakout-Game

Final project in which I had to create Breakout game in which the user must move a paddle to prevent a ball from reaching the bottom of the screen. Player wins when the ball hits and eliminates all of the bricks above. This assignment gives OOP practice regarding creating classes, using stateful controllers, and communication between them to create a successful interactive GUI. I created the breakout.py, model.py, constants.py, and play.py files while the rest were given to help with the GUI.
